To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Don’t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods.

    "The average we got is around 21 using the no return random walk with random resampling, making sure that most of the time we don't count the same people twice and that each of our datapoints is unique hopefully giving us a better overview over the whole network. In addition, when choosing a neighboring node for the random walk proves difficult (over ten tries of choosing a friend returns a friend already visited) then the algorithm chooses another node to retry based on a weighted distribution. The weights of that distribution are based on the amount of friends a user has which hopefully helps explore more of the network. Reversing the weights order, such that people with less friends are more likely to be picked surprisingly didn't have much effect \n"
